# Soccer matches in Europe

<b> Analysis of the European Soccer Database with over 28000 Matches in 11 Leagues between season 2008/2009 and 2015/2016. </b>

In this repository I want to do several projects. Theese are one data engineering and two data analysis project. <br>
First, build up of a Data Warehouse on AWS server.
Secondary, analysis of game results, home-team advantage, and performance of Hamburger SV.

<b> Getting database from Kaggle </b>

The database is available on Kaggle. Here is a short overwiev of commands, which are needed for searching and downloading. <br>

- Seaching for European Soccer Database based on title <br>
  kaggle datasets list -s 'European Soccer Database' <br>
- Searching for Databases based on reference <br>
  kaggle datasets files hugomathien/soccer <br>
- Download European Soccer Database from reference hugomathien/soccer <br>
  kaggle datasets download hugomathien/soccer -f database.sqlite -p 'Z:/IT-Projekte/FIFA soccer analysis/' <br>

<b> Initialization of a data warehouse </b>

The chosen DWH is the data vault. It is built with two python scripts on my AWS account. <br>
Data are extracted from the sql-database and loaded into the data vault. <br>

<i> fifa_dwh_lib.py </i> <br>

- About: module for fifa_data_vault.py. It contains subroutines for creating hubs, satelites, and links, inserting into existing hubs and creating hashkeys. <br>
- Code: Python 3.6 <br>
- Dependencies: Postgres SQL and connection to AWS server <br>
- Packages: numpy, pandas, datetime, string, sqlalchemy, psycopg2, hashlib, sqlite3 <br>

<i> fifa_data_vault.py </i> <br>

<b> Analysis of game results </b>

Analysis of 25979 soccer games in 11 European leagues between the seasons 2008/2009 and 2015/2016. Four tables are nedded from the European soccer database. These are leque, country, match, and team. The analysis consists of three major parts. <br>

- imvestigation of game results: most likely results, relation between home--team victory and away-team victory, number of goals
- ivestigation of home-team advantage for each legue and season including statistical evaluation with t-tesst
- performance of Hamburger SV in comparison to FC Bayern Munich: points and goals
